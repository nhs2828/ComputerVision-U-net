Hello,
This is an implementation of [U-net ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) on [Breast Ultrasound Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset) dataset.
I created 2 models, the layers of first model have the same dimension as the model in the article, but its performance after training is not great. The second model keeps the dimension of input throughout the layers.

The resultats after 50 epochs of training.
